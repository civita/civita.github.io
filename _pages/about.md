Hello, I'm Michael Chang, a dynamic and results-driven software professional with a strong background in Computer Science. Holding a Master's in Computer Science from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and a Master's in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), I bring a rich blend of academic excellence and practical experience to the table.

My journey includes impactful roles such as a Software Engineer in Test (SET) Intern at [Oracle NetSuite](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml), where I honed my skills in Java, TypeScript, and RESTful API testing. During my tenure at An-Hui Information Technology, I served as a Full Stack Developer, contributing to the development of a web RESTful API service and Dockerized solutions. My dedication to excellence is reflected in my academic achievements, including a stellar GPA of 3.97/4.00 at the University of Texas and 4.25/4.30 at National Taiwan University.

With a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Golang, coupled with expertise in backend technologies, Linux, and version control systems, I am well-equipped to navigate the complexities of software development. Let's connect to explore how my skills and experiences can contribute to your team's success.

Beyond the world of coding, I am passionate about photography, capturing the natural beauty of [landscapes](https://www.behance.net/gallery/93550799/Yellowstone), the various phases of the moon, the magic of long exposure, and the unique perspectives offered by [aerial shots](https://www.behance.net/gallery/172027119/Winter-in-Eastern-Sierra-Hwy395). With over 10 occasions of experience in [concert photography](https://www.behance.net/gallery/140331597/Behind-the-Scenes), I utilize the Canon RF system and am proficient in post-processing with Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and DaVinci Resolve, finding joy in seamlessly blending technology and art.
