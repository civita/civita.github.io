Hello, I'm Michael Chang, a dynamic and results-driven software professional with a strong background in Computer Science. Holding a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin and a Master's in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Taiwan University, I bring a rich blend of academic excellence and practical experience to the table.

My journey includes impactful roles such as a Software Engineer in Test (SET) Intern at Oracle NetSuite, where I honed my skills in Java, TypeScript, and RESTful API testing. During my tenure at An-Hui Information Technology, I served as a Full Stack Developer, contributing to the development of a web RESTful API service and Dockerized services. My dedication to excellence is reflected in my academic achievements, including a stellar GPA of 3.97/4.00 at the University of Texas and 4.25/4.30 at National Taiwan University.

With a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Golang, coupled with expertise in backend technologies, Linux, and version control systems, I am well-equipped to navigate the complexities of software development. Let's connect to explore how my skills and experiences can contribute to your team's success.
